# Soilwatch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the front facing part of user data.

This is a work in progress and worked on in my free time. The project aims to conserve water and make plant watering a more scientific process. I believe with enough data we can understand how plants wish to be watered.

## Todo:
* Add Rackt Router
* Add graphs
* Add quick stats
* Add user login with oAuth. Firebase looks promising
* Make it prettier
* Add 24hr, 12hr, 1hr change for quickview.
* Add homepage
* Change repo name to soilwatch
